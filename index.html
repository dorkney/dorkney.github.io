                <b>It's All About the Animals, Inc.</b> is a cage free, no kill, <a href="https://www.501c3.org/what-is-a-501c3/">501(c)(3)</a>nonprofit animal shelter. We give abused and abandoned animals the opportunity to receive the love, care, and shelter they need until they find furrever homes. Our cats have space to run, play, and explore safe enclosed outdoor areas (aka "catios"). A visit to our shelter will brighten your heart and bring you smiles! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Our shelter operates solely on your generous donations. Please consider helping our cause. 100% of your donation will provide food, supplies, and medical care. We don't have any paid employees, only amazing volunteers!
                <br>
                <br>
                All cats available for adoption have been spayed/neutered and have received ALL vaccines for distemper and rabies. They've been de-wormed (tapeworm and roundworm), de-flea'd, treated for ear mites, tested for leukemia, FIV, and heartworm. All kittens are treated for coccidia and giardia. Each cat is given a microchip and registered with a professionally managed database. Adoptions range from $200-$225 depending on the cat's age. UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS FOR ADOPTION FEES.

            <h1>ATTENTION CAT LOVERS: VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY!</h1>
            Does being surrounded by lots of affectionate felines for a couple of hours per week sound like nirvana to you?  If so, please consider volunteering with us!  We have several “kitty maid” openings available.  This includes feeding, light cleaning, litter box maintenance, and of course kitty snuggling.  All volunteers must be self-sufficient with their own transportation, and understand that this is a long term commitment!  If interested, please visit the shelter during adoption hours (Saturday and Sunday from 1pm to 4pm).

                        <br>
                        1. You failed to mention that I would be kept up all night because Cody is broken.....well actually, his off switch is broken. This cat NEVER stops purring. NEVER!!!!!!!
                        <br>
                        2. You failed to mention that we would INSTANTLY fall in love with this little guy.
                        <br>
                        3. You had a cat on facebook that had a tiny little meow. Well, Cody has an even tinier meow than that one. It's wicked, wicked tiny!
                        <br>
                        That being said. He and Mufasa are getting along quite well. Mufie hisses at him occasionally but there is no contact so I'm positive everything will work out fine in time.
                        <br>
                        Cody was just fine with all the ruckus the kids raised. He would scoot out of whatever room they were in but then come right back and over the course of the two days he was just hanging out no matter what the noise level.
                        <br>
                        We're off to the vet tonite - Mufie needs his rabies and Cody will be going for his "new kitty" exam.
                        <br>
                        So, madame, you made a wonderful call on his personality and we are so glad you called us to be his forever home! Will keep you posted on all the happings with these two.
